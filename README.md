# AI-Sketch-Generator-Using-OpenCV
    This code is a Python script using OpenCV library to create a pencil sketch from an image. The user inputs the name of the image to be processed. The script then reads the image, converts it to grayscale, inverts it, applies Gaussian blur, inverts it again, divides the grayscaled image by the inverted blurred image to create the sketch, adds text to the image, saves it, and finally displays the original image and the sketch image.
